# What is this project?

It's a learning exercise for implementing and visualizing common machine learning models. The model implementations here are meant to work but are not highly optimized or production ready.

# Todo
- Implement models
  - Logistic regression
  - Softmax regression
  - Naive bayes
  - Bayesian linear regression
  - Bayesian logistic regression
- Implement optimizers
  - SGD
- Bokeh & visualizations
  - Plot & add new points
  - Visualize regression line or decision boundary
  - Visualize predictive distribution with error bars for Bayesian models
